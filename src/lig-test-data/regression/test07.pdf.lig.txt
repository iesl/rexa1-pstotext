ABSTRACT 
In speech coding at low bit-rates, the computation of 
a robust excitation signal is a key point, whichchar- 
acterizes the perceptive quality provided byavocoder. 
Recently a lot of work has been done in this direction, 
namely for good quality and coding efficiency in the 
design of vocoders [4-6]. This work proposes a set of 
algorithms which apply the rationale of the Analysis- 
by-Synthesis together with High Resolution technique 
to low-bit rate coding. In the following we shall call 
this technique High Resolution Analysis-by-Synthesis 
(HRAS). As a whole this method provides a precise 
Analysis parameter estimation and a detailed excita- 
tion signal used in signal reconstruction. 
1. THE HRAS TECHNIQUE 
The high resolution analysis is based on the ''frac- 
tional'' pitch technique, introduced in [1,2]. The syn- 
thesis in HRAS, is provided bytwotypes of excita- 
tion signals: a train of prototypes at pitch distance, 
The 
is used as the second orthogonal compo- 
nent of the total excitation. The proposed work deals 
with algorithms for the computation of the component 
which is related to the high resolution task in 
the signal reconstruction process. To this purpose an 
by a train of pro- 
totypes which are adapted at each pitch period on a 
frame-by-frame basis:

where N is the length of the synthesis frame and M 
the pitch lag estimated in the analysis step. The syn- 
(n) are, respectively, the 
temporal extension of each prototype waveform, the 
corresponding phase term and the long term excitation. 
The latter parameters should be computed through the 
minimization of the weighted reconstruction error en- 
ergy over the synthesis frame:

(n) is the weighted pulse response of the all- 
(n)=yw (n),yw0 (n) is the weighted dif- 
ference between the original signal,y(n), and the term 
(n) [3]. Aweighting filter was 
chosen according to perceptive considerations given in 
[7]. No closed solution exists for the corresponding so- 
lution of equation (2), which results almost irresolvable 
for real time applications.Hence different sub-optimal 
procedures can be tried according to hypothesis applied 
to the signal reconstruction process. Three approaches 
will be presented. 
1. The first method is based on the assumption 
that the signal in the analysis frame (usu- 
ally in the range 20-30 ms) is not stationary. 
In this case each prototype is computed tak- 
ing into account the contribution of the past 
prototypes.This way the computation of each 
prototype results in a sequence of minimiza- 
tion problems (and into the solution of the 
corresponding linear systems) associated to 
each pitch period. 
2. As for the second approach, the station- 
ary hypothesis within the analysis frame is 
used for efficient modeling of the prototype 
is obtained 
by means of a gain vector modulating a pro- 
totype associated to the processed frame. As

opposed to the first method the error energy 
minimization is carried out all along the anal- 
ysis frame and the prototype is derived by the 
solution of only two linear systems. 
3. In the third procedure no assumptions are 
made on the nature of the excitation signal

solution for the minimization problem stated

makes it possible to recover not only the 
matching errors between the estimated anal- 
ysis parameters and the reference signal to be 
synthesized,but also the slowly time-varying 
parameters of voice signal.Fig. 1 shows the 
_##_(n)in 
case the voice signal is passing from a station- 
ary interval into another. In fig. 2 an attack 
to a stationary piece of signal is processed 
as well.It 
is evident , in both cases, the good adaptation 
of the excitation signal to spectral changes. 
The three methods proposed for modelling the ex- 
citation signal in case of voiced speech, allow to face 
to the quasi-stationary nature of speech signal at low 
bitrates. The way they have to be used depends upon 
the constraints of the coding scheme:variable or fixed 
bit rate coding, algorithm computational cost, cod- 
ing effectiveness and objective performance. The first

method has the lowest computational cost and it better 
fits in a fixed bitrate coding.The second procedure has 
the highest coding e_##_ciency,when used in a variable bi- 
trate coding scheme.The last algorithm presented gives 
the best objective and subjective performance while 
keeping low the bitrate associated. 
The main contribution of this work stands in the in- 
troduction of the the High Resolution Analysis and of 
the Analysis-by-Synthesis for low bitrate coding. As a 
result, the HRAS technique provides both a beneficial 
introduction of a fine description of the spectral pa- 
rameters and a high performance signal reconstruction 
step.
