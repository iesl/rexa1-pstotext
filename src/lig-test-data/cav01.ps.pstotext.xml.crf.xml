      <abstract>Abstract. As new Internet applications emerge, new security protocols and systems need to be designed and implemented. Unfortunately the current protocol design and implementation process is often ad-hoc and error prone. To solve this problem, we have designed and implemented a toolkit AGVI, Automatic Generation, Verification, and Implementation of Security Protocols. With AGVI, the protocol designer inputs the system specification (such as cryptographic key setup) and security requirements. AGVI will then automatically find the near-optimal protocols for the specific application, proves the correctness of the protocols and implement the protocols in Java. Our experiments have successfully generated new and even simpler protocols than the ones documented in the literature.</abstract>

    <body>1 Introduction 
As the Internet and electronic commerce prospers, new applications emerge 
rapidly and require that new security protocols and systems are designed and 
deployed quickly. Unfortunately, numerous examples show that security 
protocols are dicult to design, to verify the correctness, and particularly hard to 
implement correctly: 
{ Different security protocols even with the same security properties vary in 
many system aspects such as computation overhead, communication 
overhead and battery power consumption. Therefore it is important to design 
optimal security protocols that suit specific applications. Unfortunately the 
current process of designing a security protocol is usually ad-hoc and 
involves little formalism and mechanical assistance. Such a design process is 
not only slow and error prone but also often miss the optimal protocols for 
specific applications. 
{ Experience shows that security protocols are often flawed even when they 
are designed with care. To guarantee the correctness of security protocols, 
we need formal and rigorous analysis of the protocols, especially automatic 
protocol verifiers. 
{ Software is notoriously flawed. Even if the design of the security protocol is 
correct, various implementation bugs introduced by programmers could still 
easily break the security of the system. 
To solve these problems, we designed and implemented the AGVI toolkit 
which stands for Automatic Generation, Verification, and Implementation of 
Security Protocols. With AGVI, the protocol designer specifies the desired 
security requirements, such as authentication and secrecy, and system specification, 
e.g., symmetric or asymmetric encryption/decryption, low bandwidth. A protocol 
generator then generates candidate security protocols which satisfy the system 
requirements using an intelligent exhaustive search in a combinatorial protocol 
space. Then a protocol screener analyzes the candidate protocols, discards the 
flawed protocols, and outputs the correct protocols that satisfy the desired 
security properties. In the final step, a code generator automatically outputs a Java 
implementation from the formal specification of the generated security protocols. 
Even a simple security protocol can have an enormous protocol space (for 
example, for a four-round authentication protocol, even after constraining 
message format and sending order, we estimate that there are at least 10 12 possible 
variation protocols that one would need to consider to find an optimal one for the 
specific application!). Facing this challenge, we have developed powerful 
reduction techniques for the protocol generator to weed out obviously flawed protocols. 
Because the protocol generator uses simple criteria to rule out obviously flawed 
protocols, it is fast and can analyze 10; 000 protocols per second. Protocols that 
were not found flawed by the protocol generator are then send to the protocol 
screener which can prove whether the protocol is correct or not. Our protocol 
screener has the ability to analyze protocol executions with any arbitrary 
protocol configuration. When it terminates, it either provides a proof that a protocol 
satisfies its specified property under any arbitrary protocol configuration if it 
is the case, or it generates a counterexample if the property does not hold. It 
also exploits many state space reduction techniques to achieve high eciency. 
On average, our protocol screener can check 5 to 10 synthesized protocols per 
second (measured on a 500 MHz Pentium III workstation running Linux). 
We have successfully experimented with AGVI in several applications. We 
have found new protocols for authentication and key distribution protocols using 
AGVI and some of them are even simpler than the standard protocols 
documented in the literature such as ISO standards [Int93]. Details about the 
experiments and techniques in the tool can be found in [PS00a,PS00b]. 
2 Components in AGVI 
2.1 The Protocol Generator 
Our protocol generator generates candidate protocols that satisfy the specified 
system specification and discards obviously flawed protocols at an early stage. 
Intuitively, the protocol space is infinite. To solve this problem is to use iterative 
deepening, a standard search technique. In each iteration, we set a cost threshold 
of protocols. We then search through the protocol space to generate all the 
protocols below the given cost threshold. After sorting the protocols, the protocol 
screener tests them in the order of increasing cost. If one protocol satisfies the 
desired properties, it is minimal with respect to the cost metric function given 
by the user and the generation process stops. Otherwise, we increase the cost 
threshold and generate more protocols. 
A simple three-party authentication and key distribution protocol has a 
protocol space of order 10 12 . Our protocol generator generates and analyzes 10000 
protocols per second, which would take over three years to explore the entire 
space. We have developed powerful protocol space reduction techniques to prune 
the search tree at an early stage. With these pruning techniques, it only takes 
the protocol generator a few hours to scan through the protocol space of order 
10 12 . More details are included in [PS00a,PS00b]. 
2.2 The Protocol Screener 
We use Athena as the protocol screener [Son99,SBP00]. Athena uses an extension 
of the recently proposed Strand Space Model [THG98] to represent protocol 
execution. Athena incorporates a new logic that can express security properties 
including authentication, secrecy and properties related to electronic commerce. 
An automatic procedure enables Athena to evaluate well-formed formulae in 
this logic. For a well-formed formula, if the evaluation procedure terminates, it 
will generate a counterexample if the formula is false, or provide a proof if the 
formula is true. Even when the procedure does not terminate when we allow any 
arbitrary configurations of the protocol execution, (for example, any number of 
initiators and responders), termination could be forced by bounding the number 
of concurrent protocol runs and the length of messages, as is done in most existing 
automatic tools. 
Athena also exploits several state space reduction techniques. Powered with 
techniques such as backward search and symbolic representation, Athena 
naturally avoids the state space explosion problem commonly caused by asynchronous 
composition and symmetry redundancy. Athena also has the advantage that it 
can easily incorporate results from theorem proving through unreachability 
theorems. By using the unreachability theorems, it can prune the state space at 
an early stage, hence, further reduce the state space explored and increase the 
likely-hood of termination. These techniques dramatically reduce the state space 
that needs to be explored. 
2.3 The Code Generator 
Our goal for the automatic code generator is to prevent implementation 
weaknesses, and obtain a secure implementation if the initial protocol is secure. The 
code generator is essentially a translator which translates the formal specification 
into Java code. Given that the translation rules are correct, the final impleme- 
nation can be shown to be correct using proof by construction. In particular, 
we show that our implementation is secure against some of the most common 
vulnerabilities: 
{ Buffer overruns account for more than half of all recent security 
vulnerabilities. Since we use Java as our implementation language, our automatically 
generated code is immune against this class of attack. 
{ False input attacks result from unchecked input parameters or unchecked 
conditions or errors. Our automatic implementation ensures that all input 
parameters are carefully checked to have the right format before used. 
{ Type flaws occur when one message component can be interpreted as 
another message component of a different form. In the implementation, we use 
typed messages to prevent type flaws. 
{ Replay attacks and freshness attacks are attacks where the attacker can 
reuse old message components in the attack. Athena already ensures that the 
protocols are secure against these attacks. To ensure that the implementation 
is secure, we use cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators 
to create secure nonces. 
The code generator uses the same protocol description as Athena uses. The 
generated code provides a simple yet flexible API for the application programmer 
to interface with. More details about the code generator can be found in [PPS00].

3 Experiments 
We have used AGVI to automatically generate and implement authentication 
and key distribution protocols involving two parties with or without a trusted 
third party. In one experiment, we vary the system aspects: one system 
specication has a low computation overhead but a high communication overhead 
and another system specication has a low communication overhead and a high 
computation overhead. The AGVI found different optimal protocols for metric 
functions used in the two different cases. In another experiment, we vary the 
security properties required by the system. Key distribution protocols normally 
have a long list of possile security properties and an application might only 
require a subset of the list. The AGVI also found different optimal protocols for 
different security requirements. In both experiments, AGVI found new 
protocols that are more ecient or as ecient as the protocols documented in the 
literature. More details can be found in [PS00a,PS00b].
