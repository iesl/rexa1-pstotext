These ps/pdf files are used to test the new ligature-correction feature of
pstotext.  You can use ../dev-util/convert.pl or ../dev-util/convert-all.pl to
generate the text output.

*.lig.txt         files contain ligature-corrected text.
*.txt             files contain text without ligature corrections.
*.ps2ascii.txt    files contain text converted by ps2ascii program (which
                  appears to be able to convert ligatures for many documents 
                  without any special effort)
