    <body>ABSTRACT 
In speech coding at low bit-rates, the computation of 
a robust excitation signal is a key point, whichchar- 
acterizes the perceptive quality provided byavocoder. 
Recently a lot of work has been done in this direction, 
namely for good quality and coding efficiency in the 
design of vocoders [4-6]. This work proposes a set of 
algorithms which apply the rationale of the Analysis- 
by-Synthesis together with High Resolution technique 
to low-bit rate coding. In the following we shall call 
this technique High Resolution Analysis-by-Synthesis 
(HRAS). As a whole this method provides a precise 
Analysis parameter estimation and a detailed 
excitation signal used in signal reconstruction. 
1. THE HRAS TECHNIQUE 
The high resolution analysis is based on the "
fractional" pitch technique, introduced in [1,2]. The 
synthesis in HRAS, is provided bytwotypes of 
excitation signals: a train of prototypes at pitch distance, 
#(n) and a stochastic codebook excitation, #(n). The 
input #(n) is used as the second orthogonal 
component of the total excitation. The proposed work deals 
with algorithms for the computation of the component 
#(n), which is related to the high resolution task in 
the signal reconstruction process. To this purpose an 
enhanced excitation #(n)isprovided by a train of 
prototypes which are adapted at each pitch period on a 
frame-by-frame basis: 
#(n) = 
bN=M c, 1 
X 
i=0 
L 
X 
j= , L 
# i;j 
(n)#(n, n 0 , iM , j) (1) 
where N is the length of the synthesis frame and M 
the pitch lag estimated in the analysis step. The 
synthesis parameters L, n 0 , # i;j (n) are, respectively, the 
temporal extension of each prototype waveform, the 
corresponding phase term and the long term excitation. 
The latter parameters should be computed through the 
minimization of the weighted reconstruction error 
energy over the synthesis frame:

X

L 
X 
j= , L 
# i;j (n)hw (n , n 0 , iM , j)) 2 
(2) 
where hw (n) is the weighted pulse response of the all- 
pole model, ~ y w (n)=yw (n) , y w0 (n) is the weighted 
difference between the original signal,y(n), and the term 
due to the free response y 0 (n) [3]. Aweighting filter was 
chosen according to perceptive considerations given in 
[7]. No closed solution exists for the corresponding 
solution of equation (2), which results almost irresolvable 
for real time applications.Hence different sub-optimal 
procedures can be tried according to hypothesis applied 
to the signal reconstruction process. Three approaches 
will be presented. 
1. The first method is based on the assumption 
that the signal in the analysis frame (
usually in the range 20-30 ms) is not stationary. 
In this case each prototype is computed 
taking into account the contribution of the past 
prototypes.This way the computation of each 
prototype results in a sequence of 
minimization problems (and into the solution of the 
corresponding linear systems) associated to 
each pitch period. 
2. As for the second approach, the 
stationary hypothesis within the analysis frame is 
used for efficient modeling of the prototype 
train. Thus the excitation #(n) is obtained 
by means of a gain vector modulating a 
prototype associated to the processed frame. As

opposed to the first method the error energy 
minimization is carried out all along the 
analysis frame and the prototype is derived by the 
solution of only two linear systems. 
3. In the third procedure no assumptions are 
made on the nature of the excitation signal 
#(n). This approach turns out to be the best 
solution for the minimization problem stated 
in equation (2), compared to the other two 
methods, but it has a greater computational 
cost. The coefficients # i;j are computed by 
means of a closed form, once the terms n 0 
and L are derived with a suboptimal 
procedure. The adaptive structure of the signal 
#(n) makes it possible to recover not only the 
matching errors between the estimated 
analysis parameters and the reference signal to be 
synthesized,but also the slowly time-varying 
parameters of voice signal.Fig. 1 shows the 
reconstructed signal by using signal #(n)in 
case the voice signal is passing from a 
stationary interval into another. In fig. 2 an attack 
to a stationary piece of signal is processed 
and reconstructed with signal #(n), as well.It 
is evident , in both cases, the good adaptation 
of the excitation signal to spectral changes. 
The three methods proposed for modelling the 
excitation signal in case of voiced speech, allow to face 
to the quasi-stationary nature of speech signal at low 
bitrates. The way they have to be used depends upon 
the constraints of the coding scheme:variable or fixed 
bit rate coding, algorithm computational cost, 
coding effectiveness and objective performance. The first

method has the lowest computational cost and it better 
fits in a fixed bitrate coding.The second procedure has 
the highest coding e#ciency,when used in a variable 
bitrate coding scheme.The last algorithm presented gives 
the best objective and subjective performance while 
keeping low the bitrate associated. 
The main contribution of this work stands in the 
introduction of the the High Resolution Analysis and of 
the Analysis-by-Synthesis for low bitrate coding. As a 
result, the HRAS technique provides both a beneficial 
introduction of a fine description of the spectral 
parameters and a high performance signal reconstruction 
step.</body>
