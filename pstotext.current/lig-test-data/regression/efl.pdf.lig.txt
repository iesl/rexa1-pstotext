(PNAS) is one of world's most cited multidisciplinary 
scientific journals. The PNAS official classification structure of subjects is reflected in topic labels submitted 
by the authors of manuscripts, largely related to traditionally established disciplines. These include broad 
field classifications into Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Social Sciences, and further subtopic classifi- 
cations within the fields. Focusing on Biological Sciences, we explore an internal soft classification structure 
of articles based only on semantic decompositions of abstracts and bibliographies, and compare it with the 
formal discipline classifications. 
Our model assumes that there is a fixed number of internal categories, each characterized by multino- 
mial distributions over words (in abstracts) and references (in bibliographies). Soft classification for each 
article is based on proportions of the article's content coming from each category. We discuss the appropri- 
ateness of the model for the PNAS database as well as other features of the data relevant to soft classification. 
"The Proceedings is there to help bring new ideas promptly into play. New ideas may not always be right, but 
their prominent presence can lead to correction. We must be careful not to censor those ideas which seem to be off 
beat." Saunders MacLane, PNAS, Vol. 94, pp. 5983-5985, June 1997 
that we can 
obtain empirically with statistical data mining tools based only on semantic decompositions of words and refer- 
ences used? Can we identify MacLane's "off-beat" but potentially path-breaking PNAS papers using these internal 
categories? Do these empirically defined categories correspond in some natural way to the classification by field 
used to organize the papers for publication, or does PNAS publish substantial numbers of interdisciplinary papers 
that transcend these disciplinary boundaries? These are examples of questions that our contribution to the mapping 
of knowledge domains represented by PNAS attempts to explore. 
A number of mathematical and statistical techniques have been developed for analyzing complex data in ways 
that could reveal underlying data patterns through some form of classification. Computational advances have 
made some of these techniques extremely popular in recent years. For example, two of the ten most cited articles 
from 1997-2001 PNAS publications are on applications of clustering for gene expression patterns [1, 2]. The 
traditional assumption in most methods that aim to discover knowledge in underlying data patterns has been that 
each subject (object or individual) from the population of interest inherently belongs to only one of the underlying 
subpopulations (clusters, classes, aspects, or pure type categories). This implies that a subject shares all of its 
attributes, usually with some degree of uncertainty, with the subpopulation to which it belongs. Given that a 
relatively small number of subpopulations is often necessary for a meaningful interpretation of the underlying 
patterns, many data collections do not conform with the traditional assumption. Subjects in such populations may 
combine attributes from several subpopulations simultaneously. In other words, they may have a mixed collection 
of attributes originating from more than one subpopulation. 
Several different disciplines have developed approaches that have a common statistical structure which we 
refer to as mixed membership. In genetics, mixed membership models can account for the fact that individual 
genotypes may come from different subpopulations according to (unknown) proportions of an individual's ancestry. 
Rosenberg et al. [3] use such a model to analyze genetic samples from 52 human populations around the globe, 
1 
identifying major genetic clusters without using the geographic information about the origins of individuals. In the 
Social Sciences, such models are natural since members of a society can exhibit mixed membership with respect 
to the underlying social or health groups for a particular problem being studied. Hence, individual responses to a 
series of questions may have mixed origins. Woodbury et al. [4] employ this idea to develop medical classification. 
In text analysis and information retrieval, mixed membership models have been used to account for different topical 
aspects of individual documents. 
In the following section we describe a class of mixed membership models that unifies existing special cases 
[5]. We then explain how this class of models can be adapted to analyze both the semantic content of a document 
and its citations of other publications. We fit this document-oriented mixed membership model to a subcollection 
of the PNAS database supplied to the participants in the Arthur M. Sackler Colloquium on "Mapping Knowledge 
Domains." We focus in our analysis on a high level description of the fields in Biological Sciences in terms of 
a small number of extreme or basis categories. Griffiths and Steyvers [6] use a related version of the model for 
abstracts only and attempt a finer level of description. 
Mixed Membership Models 
The general mixed membership model we work with relies on four levels of assumptions: population, subject, 
latent variable, and sampling scheme. Population level assumptions describe the general structure of the population 
that is common to all subjects. Subject level assumptions specify the distribution of observable responses given 
individual membership scores. Membership scores are usually unknown and hence can also be viewed as latent 
variables. The next assumption is whether the membership scores are treated as fixed or random in the model. 
Finally, the last level of assumption specifies the number of distinct observed characteristics (attributes) and the 
number of replications for each characteristic. We describe each set of assumptions formally in turn.

With respect to the latent variables, one could either assume that they are fixed unknown

[11] both assume that a single characteristic (word) is 
observed a number of times for each document, but the former model considers the membership scores as fixed

The mixed membership model framework presented above unifies several specialized models that have been 
developed independently in the social sciences, genetics, and text mining applications. In the text mining area, 
[10] was followed by the work of Blei et al. [11], 
who proposed a Dirichlet generating distribution for the membership scores and the use of variational methods 
model parameters. Minka and Lafferty [12] develop a more accurate 
approximation method for this model. 
A natural extension of the original analyses in the text mining area that have been based on a single source is to 
combine information from multiple sources. Cohn and Hofmann [13] propose a probabilistic model of document 
content and hypertext connectivity for text documents by considering links (or references) in addition to words, 
thus, essentially combining two distinct characteristics; they treat the membership scores as fixed. Following Cohn 
and Hofmann, we adopt a mixed membership model for words and references in journal publications but treat the 
membership scores as random Dirichlet realizations. Barnard et al. [14] develop similar and alternative approaches 
for combining different sources of information. 
Mixed Membership Models for Documents 
We can use the general model framework for documents consisting of abstracts and references by representing

Since distributions of words and references in a 
document are convex combinations of the aspects' distributions, the aspects can be thought of as extreme or basis 
categories for a collection of documents. The sampling of words and references in the model can also be interpreted 
as a latent classification process where an aspect of origin is drawn first for each word and for each reference in a 
and words and references are then generated from corresponding distributions of the aspects of origin [5]. Rather

It is important to note that the assumption of exchangeability among words and references (conditional inde- 
pendence given the membership scores) does not imply joint independence among the observed characteristics. 
Instead, the assumption of exchangeability means that dependencies among words and references can be fully ex- 
plained by the documents' membership scores. For an extended discussion on exchangeability in this context, see 
[15]. 
Alternative Models for References 
For the analysis of PNAS publications in the next section, we assume multinomial sampling of words and 
references. While multinomial sampling is computationally convenient, it is not a realistic model of the way in 
which authors select references for the bibliography of a paper. We briefly describe examples of more realistic 
generative assumptions for references. 
Suppose an article focuses on a sufficiently narrow scientific area. In this case the authors may have essentially 
perfect knowledge of the literature and thus they would pay separate attention to each paper in their pool of 
references as they consider whether to include it in the bibliography. Under these circumstances, given that the

(14) 
The likelihood function based on this alternative model would not only 
take into account which documents contain which references, but it would also incorporate the information about 
which references documents do not contain. 
Alternatively we could consider a reference list as being generated by a two-step combination of multinomial 
and Bernoulli draws where authors first select a pool of references determined by the compositional structure of 
the research (multinomial sampling) and then decide which references are most relevant for the current document 
and which are not (Bernoulli sampling). Yet another alternative is to assume that the authors have knowledge 
of importance only regarding those papers that are of similar decomposition. The probabilities of including a 
reference to a paper that is within an area of expertise may then depend on the contextual decomposition of citing 
that paper (multinomial or Bernoulli sampling). The probabilities of giving a reference to a paper that is outside 
of the area of expertise may then be considered a constant, which is equivalent to saying that references to papers 
that are outside of the area of expertise occur by chance. 
Both the basic model for references and any alternatives would still need to reflect the time ordering on pub- 
lications and include in the pool of possible references only those that have already been published, perhaps even 
with a short time lag. But even such changes are unlikely to produce a "correct" model for citation practices. As 
Box [16] reminds us, no model can be right but some models are more sensible and useful than others. 
Estimating the Model 
The primary complication in using a mixed membership model such as (7)--(9) where the membership proba- 
bilities are random rather than fixed, is that the integral in (10) cannot be computed explicitly and therefore must 
be approximated. Two approximation schemes have been recently investigated for this problem, and the associated 
(w) = 
K 
are 
bounded from below in a product form that leads to a tractable integral; the lower bound is then maximized. A re- 
lated approach, called Expectation-Propagation (EP) [12], also approximates each mixture term in a product form, 
but chooses the parameters of the factors by matching first and second moments. Either of these approximations to 
the integral (10) can be used in an approximate EM algorithm to estimate the parameters of the models. It is shown 
in [12] that EP in general leads to better approximations than the simple variational method for mixed membership 
models, although we have obtained comparable results with both approaches on the PNAS collection. The results 
reported below use the variational approximation. 
The PNAS Database 
provided the database for the participants of the Arthur M. Sackler Col- 
loquium "Mapping Knowledge Domains." We have focused on a subset which contains all Biological Sciences 
articles in volumes 94--98 of the Proceedings which correspond to Julian years 1997-2001, thereby ignoring articles 
published in the Social and Physical Sciences unless they have official dual classifications with one classification 
in the Biological Sciences. The reason for this narrowing of focus is twofold. First, the major share of Proceed- 
ings publications in recent years represents research developments in the Biological Sciences. Thus, out of 13,008 
articles published in 94--98 volumes, 12,036 or 92.53% are in the Biological Sciences. The share of Social and 
Physical Sciences articles in volumes 94--98 is a much more modest 7.47%. Second, we assume a collection of 
papers is characterized by mixed membership in a number of internal categories, and Social and Physical Sciences 
5 
papers are unlikely to share the same internal categories with papers from the Biological Sciences. We also auto- 
matically ignore other types of PNAS publications such as corrections, commentaries, letters, and reviews because 
these are not traditional research reports. Among the Biological Sciences papers in our database, eleven articles 
were not processed because they did not have an abstract, and one article was not processed because it did not 
contain any references. 
PNAS is one of world's most cited multidisciplinary scientific journals. Historically, when submitting a re- 
search paper to the Proceedings, authors have to select a major category from Physical, Biological, or Social 
Sciences, and a minor category from the list of topics. The Proceedings permits dual classifications between 
major categories and, in exceptional cases, within a major category. The lists of topics change over time to re- 
flect changes in the Academy sections. As stated in the PNAS information for authors revised in June 2002, 
official classification of PNAS publications in Biological Sciences contains 19 topics: Biochemistry, Medical Sci- 
ences, Neurobiology, Cell Biology, Genetics, Immunology, Biophysics, Evolution, Microbiology, Plant Biology, 
Developmental Biology, Physiology, Pharmacology, Ecology, Applied Biology, Psychology, Population Biology, 
Agricultural Sciences, and Anthropology. The percentages of published papers and numbers of dual classification 
papers in each topic are shown in Table 1.

classifications are given in parentheses. 
The topic labels provide a classification structure for published materials and most of the articles are members 
of only a single topic. For our mixed membership model, we assume that there is a fixed number of extreme 
internal categories or aspects, each of which is characterized by multinomial distributions over words (in abstracts) 
and references (in bibliographies). Aspects are determined from contextual decompositions in such a way that a 
multinomial distribution of words and references in each document is a convex combination of the corresponding 
distributions from the aspects. The convex combination for each article is based on proportions of the article's 
content coming from each category. These proportions, or membership scores, determine soft classifications of 
articles with respect to internal categories.

Results 
in this type of setting is difficult. 
In our analyses, we focused largely on two versions of the model, one with eight aspects and the other with ten. 
The set of parameters in our model is given by multinomial word and reference probabilities for each aspect, and 
by the parameters of Dirichlet distribution, which is a generating distribution for membership scores. There are 
unique references in our data, hence adding an aspect corresponds to having 
additional parameters. Because of the large numbers of parameters involved, it 
is difficult to assess the extent to which the added pair of aspects actually improve the fit of the model to the data. 
On the basis of a set of preliminary comparisons we found little to choose between them in fit and greater ease of 
interpretation for the eight aspect model. Therefore we report only the results of the eight aspect model here. 
To see whether there are certain contexts that correspond to the aspects, we examine the most common words 
in the estimated multinomial distributions. In Table 2 we report the first 15 of the high probability words for 
each aspect, filtering out so called "stop words", words that are generally common in English. An alternative way 
would be to discard the words from the "stop list" before fitting the model. If the distribution of "stop words" is 
not uniform across the internal categories, this alternative approach may potentially produce different results. 
The following interpretations are based on examination of 50 high probability words for each aspect. Note 
that enumeration of the aspects is arbitrary. The first aspect includes a number of words such as Ca2+, kinase, 
phosphorylation, receptor, g (protein) channel, that pertain to cell signaling and intracellular signal transduction. It 
is likely that in this aspect signal transduction is considered as applied to neuron signaling as indicated by the words 
synaptic, neurons, voltage. It is interesting that Ca2+ in the first aspect is the highest probability contextual word 
over all the aspects. Frequent words for the second aspect indicate that its context is related to molecular evolution 
that deals with natural selection on population and intraspecies level and mechanisms of acquiring genetic traits. 
Words in aspect 3 pertain mostly to plant molecular biology area. High probability words in aspect 4 relate to 
studies of neuronal responses in mice and humans, which identify this aspect as related to developmental biology 
and neurobiology. Aspect 5 contains words that can be associated with biochemistry and molecular biology. 
Words in aspect 6 point to genetics and molecular biology. Frequent words for aspect 7 contain such terms as 
immune, IL or interleukin, antigen, (interferon) gamma, and MHC class II, that point to a relatively new area 
in immunology, namely, tumor immunology. Presence of such words as HIV and virus in aspect 7 indicates a 
more general immunology content. For aspect 8, words such as increase or reduced, treatment, effect, fold, and 
p (assuming it stands for p-value) correspond to general reporting of experimental results, likely in the area of 
endocrinology. 
As for words, multinomial distributions are estimated for the references that are present in our collection. For 
estimation we only need unique indicators for each referenced paper. After the model is fitted, attributes of high 
probability references for each aspect provide additional information about its contextual interpretation. Table 3 
provides attributes of 15 high probability references for each aspect that were available in the database, together 
with PNAS citation counts (number of times cited by PNAS papers in the database). Notice that because the model 
draws from the contextual decomposition, high reference count is not necessary for a reference to have high aspect 
and, 
publications from the mid-1990s. 
Examining titles of the references (not shown), we see that manuals, textbooks, and references to articles 
that describe particular methodology appear to be prominent for many aspects. Thus, among the first 15 high 
probability references, all 15 from aspect 3, and more than half from aspect 4 are of this methodological type. In 
contrast, most high probability references for aspect 7 are those that report new findings. Titles of the references 
indicate neurobiology content for aspect 1, molecular evolution for aspect 2, and plant molecular biology for aspect 
3, which is in agreement with our conclusions based on high probability words. For other aspects, titles of hight 
probability references help us to refine the aspects. Thus, aspect 4 mostly pertains to study of brain development, in 
particular, via genetic manipulation of mouse embryo. Aspect 5, identified as biochemistry and molecular biology 
by the words, can be described as protein structural biology by the references. Aspect 6 may be labelled more 
detailed as "DNA repair, mutagenesis, and cell cycle." The references for aspects 7 and 8 shift their focuses more

Among frequent references for the eight aspects, there are seven PNAS papers, two of which appear in two 
aspects. These seven papers share a special feature: they were all either co-authored or contributed by a distin- 
guished member of the National Academy of Sciences. In fact, one paper was co-authored by a Nobel prize winner 
and two were contributed by other Nobelists. Although these papers do not have the highest counts in the database, 
they are notable for various reasons; e.g., one is on clustering and gene expression [1], and it is also one of the 
two highly cited PNAS papers on clustering which we mentioned in the introduction. These seven papers may 
not necessarily be "off-beat," but they may be among those that fulfill Saunders MacLane's petition regarding the 
special nature of PNAS. 
From our analysis of high probability words, it is difficult to see whether the majority of aspects correspond to a 
single topic from the official classifications in PNAS Biological Science publications. To investigate whether there 
is a correspondence between the estimated aspects and the given topics, we examine aspect "loadings" for each 
paper. Given estimated parameters of the model, the distribution of each article's "loadings" can be obtained via 
Bayes' theorem. The variational and EP procedures provide Dirichlet approximations to the posterior distribution 
We employ the mean of this Dirichlet as an estimate of the weight of the document 
on each aspect. Histograms of these loadings are provided in Figure 4 for four topics: Biophysics, Biochemistry,

Genetics 
Figure 1: Distributions by aspect of the posterior means of membership scores for articles published in Biophysics, 
Biochemistry, Evolution, and Genetics. 
Evolution, and Genetics. Relatively high histogram bars near zero correspond to the majority of articles having 
small posterior membership scores for the given aspect. About half of the articles in Biophysics can be considered 
as full members in aspect 5, but there are also articles from this topic that are full members in aspects 3, 4 and 
6. The rest have mixed membership mostly in aspects 3 and 5. Distribution of the aspect loadings for articles in 
Biochemistry and Genetics similarly indicates that articles are coming from different aspects, and a substantial part 
of them is of mixed membership. Papers published in Evolution, on the other hand, show a somewhat different 
behavior---the majority of these papers comes fully from aspect 2. 
The sparsity of the loadings can also be gauged by the parameters of the Dirichlet distribution, which are 
= 0.0411, 
The estimated Dirichlet, which is the generative distribution of membership scores, is "bathtub 
shaped" on the simplex; as a result, articles will tend to have relatively high membership scores in only a few 
aspects. 
To summarize the aspect distributions for each topic, we provide mean loadings and the graphical representa- 
tion of these values in Figure 4. Larger values correspond to darker colors, and the values below some threshold 
for Pharmacology in the first aspect 
is the average of the posterior means of the membership scores for this aspect over all Pharmacology publications 
in the database. Note that this percentage is based on the assumption of mixed membership, and can be interpreted 
9 
as indicating that 29% of the words in Pharmacology papers originate from aspect 1, according to our model. 
Examining the rows of Figure 4, we see that most subtopics in Biological Sciences have major components 
from more than one aspect (extreme or basis category). Examining the columns, we can gain further insights in 
interpretation of the extreme categories. Aspect 8, for example, is the aspect of origin for a combined 37% of 
Physiology, 30% of Pharmacology, and 25% of Medical Sciences papers, according to the mixed membership 
model. The most prominent subtopic is Evolution; it has the greatest influence in defining an extremal category, 
aspect 2. This is consistent with a special place Evolution holds among the Biological Sciences by standing apart 
both conceptually and methodologically. 
Concluding Remarks 
We have presented results from fitting a mixed membership model to a collection of Biological Sciences pub- 
1997--2001, resulting in an implicit semantic 
decomposition of words and references in the papers. The model allows us to identify extreme internal categories 
of publications and to provide soft classifications of papers into these categories. Our results show that the tradi- 
tional discipline classifications correspond to a mixed distribution over the internal categories. Our analyses and 
modeling were intended to capture a high level description of a subset of PNAS papers. By contrast, Griffiths 
and Steyvers [6] attempt a more fine-grained description by applying a restricted version of the mixed member- 
ship model using only words in the abstracts for a larger subset of PNAS papers. We plan to present a careful 
comparison between their approach and ours in the near future. 
As noted in a famous statement by George Box [16], "all models are wrong." In our case, the assumption of a 
"bag of words and references" in the mixed membership model clearly oversimplifies reality; the model does not 
account for the general structure of the language nor does it capture the compositional structure of bibliographies. 
Many interesting extensions of the basic model we have explored are possible, from hierarchical models of topics, 
to more detailed models of citations and dynamic models of the evolution of scientific fields over time. Neverthe- 
less, as Box notes, even wrong models may be useful. Our results indicate that mixed membership models can be 
useful for analyzing the implicit semantic structure of scientific publications.
