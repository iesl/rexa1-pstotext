provide a common representation for several combinatorial 
problems and have been the key element for designing sampling algo- 
rithms. Markov chain algorithms based on routings have led to efficient 
samplers for tilings, Eulerian orientations [8] and triangulations [9], while 
an algorithm which successively calculates ratios of determinants has led 
to a very fast method for sampling fixed routings [12]. We extend Wil- 
where the num- 
ber of paths, as well as the endpoints, are allowed to vary. The algorithm 
is based on a technique due to Stembridge for counting free routings 
by calculating the Pfaffian of a suitable matrix [11] and a method of 
Colbourn, Myrvold and Neufeld [1] for efficiently calculating ratios of 
determinants. As an application, we show how to sample tilings on pla- 
nar lattice regions with free boundary conditions. 
1 Introduction 
Physicists study combinatorial structures on lattices in order to understand vari- 
ous physical systems. For example, tilings on planar lattice regions model systems 
of diatomic molecules, or dimers. By studying statistics of random configurations 
square or the Aztec dia- 
mond), physicists gain insight into the behavior of these systems on the infinite 
lattice, the so-called thermodynamic limit. 
It is well known that the boundary of the region plays a crucial role. There

boundary conditions, where 
the configurations are forced to precisely agree with the boundary. In the case of 
domino tilings this means that tiles are forced to cover all of the squares inside, 
and only inside, the region. Another important type of boundary condition con- 
in the shape 
of the region. Returning to tilings, this means that tiles can overlap the bound- 
ary (as long as the configuration can be extended to a tiling of the plane). In the

Fixed boundaries Free boundaries 
Domino tilings on regions with fixed and free boundary conditions 
One reason for studying free boundary conditions is that these eliminate 
the boundary effect due to the shape of the region (in the limit). This is not 
true for families of regions with fixed boundary conditions, where properties of 
random configurations can vary drastically according to their shape. Consider,

. With fixed boundary conditions, the 
entropy over all finite 
. In contrast, the family of Aztec diamonds is known to 
have lower entropy, which is related to the arctic circle phenomenon whereby 
frozen regions of the Aztec diamond emerge having a completely predictable 
local tiling [5]. On the other hand, with free boundary conditions, for any family 
of regions where the ratio of the length of the perimeter to the area of the region 
tends to zero, the entropy will converge to the same (maximal) value. In other 
words, statistics of tilings of square regions with free boundary conditions will 
agree with statistics of tilings of Aztec diamonds with free boundary conditions. 
Several algorithms for sampling tilings on regions with fixed boundary con- 
or sets of non- 
intersecting lattice paths where the number of paths and the position of their 
endpoints are fixed. The first is a Markov chain approach of Luby, Randall and 
Sinclair [8] which samples routings uniformly (and can be extended to the case 
where the paths are edge disjoint, but not necessarily vertex disjoint). A second 
approach, due to Wilson [12], uses the Gessel-Viennot method for enumerating 
routings by calculating a determinant [2] (and the close relationship between 
counting and sampling formalized by Jerrum, Valiant and Vazirani [4]). Wilson 
utilizes a technique introduced by Colbourn, Myrvold and Neufeld [1] which al- 
lows ratios of determinants of closely related matrices to be computed quickly 
without having to evaluate both determinants. 
or sets of non-intersecting lattice paths 
where the positions of the endpoints of the paths, as well as the number of 
paths, are allowed to vary. Our result relies on Stembridge's algorithm counting 
the number of free routings of a region by evaluating a Pfaffian [11]. We adapt 
the method of Colbourn, Myrvold and Neufeld to allow ratios of Pfaffians to 
be evaluated quickly, a special case of a technique of Kenyon for calculating

) algorithm. We apply this 
sampling method to generate random domino and lozenge tilings of hexagonal 
regions with free boundary conditions. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we review the 
counting techniques of Gessel-Viennot and Stembridge for fixed and free rout- 
ings, respectively. In section 3 we present our algorithm for uniformly sampling 
free routings. Finally, in section 4 we show the bijections between free routings 
and tilings on regions with free boundary conditions which allow us to sample 
these tilings efficiently. 
2 Background: Counting routings 
First we begin with an overview of the method of Gessel and Viennot for counting 
fixed routings and that of Stembridge for counting free routings. Wilson shows 
how to sample fixed routings using self-reducibility and iterative applications of 
the Gessel-Viennot method. We give a similar method to sample free routings, 
utilizing Stembridge's method for counting free routings.

Stembridge's result.

3 Generating random routings 
We present an algorithm to uniformly generate a free routing of a planar acyclic 
with compatible sources and sinks. This algorithm is similar to the 
determinant algorithm of [12] for generating fixed routings. Once again, we as-

We use self-reducibility to find the routing by building paths one edge at a

appropriate probabilities, and add it to the routing, thereby starting a path 
, the other end of the selected edge,

of Pfaffians can be computed efficiently to determine the probability of using a 
particular source or edge. The following theorem is analogous to the result in [1] 
for ratios of determinants of matrices that differ by a single row.

4 Lattice paths 
In this section, we demonstrate applications of the techniques from the previous 
section. We show how to generate random domino tilings of the reduced Aztec 
diamond with free boundary conditions and lozenge tilings of the hexagon with 
free boundary conditions. The key idea is the existence of a bijection between 
the set of tilings of this region and the set of free routings in a related digraph. 
For details of the analogous bijections in the case of fixed boundary conditions, 
we refer the reader to [8]. 
4.1 Domino tilings of the reduced Aztec diamond

is a tiling in which all the squares 
are covered, but the dominoes are allowed to "stick out" of (or overlap) 
the boundary of the region. We assume that we know the orientation of a domino 
that overlaps the boundary, i.e., a single square (or half-domino) is designated 
as the bottom, top, left or right half of a domino.

paths are non-intersecting since dominoes cannot overlap and because of the 
order in which the sources were examined. See figure 3 for an example of a free

points to the location of the other half of a domino that overlaps the boundary.)
